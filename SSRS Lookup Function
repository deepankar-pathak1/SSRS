=lookup(Fields!EmployeeKey.Value,Fields!ProductKey.Value,Fields!EnglishProductName.Value, "DSPRO")

Here we are doing a join on the basis of Employeekey and Product key from Employee and Product Table and in result we want 
Product Name from Both the table, which have matching key this is similiar like we use in join 



select * from [dbo].[DimEmployee]
select * from [dbo].[DimProduct]

select e.FirstName,e.LastName,e.EmployeeKey,p.EnglishProductName
from  [dbo].[DimEmployee] e
left join [dbo].[DimProduct] p
on e.EmployeeKey = p.ProductKey
