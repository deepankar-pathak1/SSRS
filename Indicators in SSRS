In Indicator we use this expression because 

=Fields!TotalProductCost.Value+1

it means that Here we are comparing this value to "[Sum(SalesAmount)]"

if salesamount value is between 0 to TotalProductcost value than it will inidcate 
a "Red" sign 
if Salesamount value is in range between TotalProductCost value to " " then it will indicate 
"Yellow" sign 

it means in clear Word that 
if sales amount is less than TotalProductCost than it will show "Yello"
else it will show "red"
